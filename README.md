# kuvaaja

This is my small personal renderer project.
I intend to keep developing it as a framework and adding features on an irregular basis.

## Building and running

### Mac
Just run `compile.sh`. This may also work on linux, although I haven't tested it yet.

### Windows
Use cmake to build the Visual Studio project in the `build` folder and then open the generated `kuvaaja.sln`.
To easily compile and run, you need to set `kuvaaja` as the startup project.
